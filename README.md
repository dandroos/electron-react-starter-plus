# electron-react-starter-plus

This is a starter I built to suit my own development needs.  It has Redux, Material-UI and NeDB baked in with some useful boilerplate code.  If you find it useful, that's fantastic!  Show it some love by giving it a star on GitHub!

## Getting started
Clone the repo...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dandroos/electron-react-starter-plus.git myAppName
```

Navigate into the directory...
```bash
cd myAppName
```

Install the dependencies...
```bash
yarn
```

Start developing...
```bash
npm start
```

Enjoy!
